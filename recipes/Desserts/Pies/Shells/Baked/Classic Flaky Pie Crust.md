# Pie Crust

This is a basic pie crust recipe that can be used for various pies, such as apple pie, pumpkin pie, and pecan pie. The flaky and buttery crust complements the sweet fillings perfectly. You can make the crust ahead of time and freeze it for later use.

This recipe makes enough dough for a double-crust pie in a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish. You can also use this crust for single-crust pies by halving the recipe or freezing the remaining dough for later.

## Ingredients

### For the Pie Crust

| Ingredient | Preparation | Quantity (Metric) | Quantity (US) |
|---|----|----|----|
| all-purpose flour (BL55) | | 400 g | 3 1/3 cups |
| salt | | 5 g | 1 tsp |
| granulated sugar | | 15 g | 1 tbsp |
| unsalted butter | cold and cut into small cubes or shredded | 225 g | 1 cup |
| ice water | | 120 ml | 1/2 cup |

> BL55 refers to French flour with a medium protein content suitable for pastry and cakes.

### For the Crust Topping (Optional)

| Ingredient | Preparation | Quantity (Metric) | Quantity (US) |
|---|----|----|----|
| egg | beaten (for egg wash) | 1 | 1 |
| granulated sugar | for sprinkling | 30 g | 2 tbsp |

## Instructions

### Prepare the Ingredients

Cut the butter into small cubes or shred it using a box grater. Keep the butter cold until ready to use.

### Make the Dough

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Mix well to distribute the ingredients evenly.

1. Add the cold butter to the flour mixture and use a pastry cutter or your fingers to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter remaining.

1. Gradually add the ice water, one tablespoon at a time, mixing gently until the dough just comes together. You may not need all the water. Be careful not to overwork the dough or it won't be flaky. The dough should be shaggy but hold together when pressed.

1. Divide the dough into two equal parts. Use a kitchen scale for accuracy. Shape each half into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 2 days. You can also freeze the dough for up to 3 months.

### Roll Out the Dough (For the Bottom Crust)

1. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly. This will make it easier to roll out. Don't let it get too warm or the butter will melt and the crust won't be as flaky.

1. On a lightly floured surface, roll out one disk of dough into a circle about 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter and 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. Use a rolling pin to transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges leaving about a 1-inch (2.5 cm) overhang.

1. Place the pie dish with the bottom crust in the refrigerator while you roll out the top crust and prepare the filling. This will help prevent the crust from shrinking during baking.

> If you're making a single-crust pie, you can blind bake the crust at this point. If you're making a double-crust pie, roll out the second disk of dough for the top crust.

### Roll Out the Dough (For the Top Crust)

1. If you're making a double-crust pie, roll out the second disk of dough into a circle about 12 inches (30 cm) in diameter and 1/8 inch (3 mm) thick. You can cut the dough into strips for a lattice crust or leave it whole for a traditional crust. Place the rolled-out dough on a parchment-lined baking sheet and refrigerate until ready to use.
