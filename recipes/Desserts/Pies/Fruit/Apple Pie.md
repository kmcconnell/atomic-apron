# Apple Pie

This is a classic apple pie recipe that is perfect for any occasion. The combination of sweet and tart apples, warm spices, and flaky crust makes this dessert a favorite among many. Serve it warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for the ultimate treat.

> You can use a store-bought frozen pie crust or make your own using the [Classic Flaky Pie Crust](../Shells/Baked/Classic%20Flaky%20Pie%20Crust.md) recipe.

## Ingredients

### For the Pie Filling

| Ingredient | Preparation | Quantity (Metric) | Quantity (US) |
|---|----|----|----|
| Granny Smith apples | peeled, cored, and sliced | 400 g | 3 cups  |
| Idared apples | peeled, cored, and sliced | 400 g | 3 cups  |
| Pink Lady apples | peeled, cored, and sliced | 400 g | 3 cups |
| granulated sugar | | 150 g | 3/4 cup |
| light brown sugar | packed | 50 g | 1/4 cup |
| all-purpose flour (BL55) | | 15 g | 2 tbsp |
| ground cinnamon | | 3 g | 1 tsp |
| ground nutmeg | | 0.5 g | 1/4 tsp |
| ground cloves | | 0.25 g | 1/8 tsp |
| lemon juice | fresh | 15 ml | 1 tbsp |
| lemon zest | fresh | 2 g | 1 tsp |
| vanilla extract | | 5 ml | 1 tsp |

> Use a mix of sweet and tart apples for a balanced flavor and texture. Granny Smith, Idared, and Pink Lady apples work well together. Avoid using Red Delicious apples as they tend to become mushy when baked.

> You can substitute the brown sugar with brown cane sugar or muscovado sugar for a richer flavor.

> BL55 refers to French flour with a medium protein content suitable for pastry and cakes.

> You can substitute the vanilla extract with vanilla bean paste or vanilla sugar for a more intense vanilla flavor. For either, use 10 g (2 tsp) in place of the extract.

### For the Crust Topping (Optional)

| Ingredient | Preparation | Quantity (Metric) | Quantity (US) |
|---|----|----|----|
| egg | beaten (for egg wash) | 1 | 1 |
| granulated sugar | for sprinkling | 30 g | 2 tbsp |

## Instructions

### Prepare the Pie Filling

1. Peel, core, and slice the apples. Place them in a large mixing bowl and toss with lemon juice and zest to prevent browning.

1. Add the granulated sugar, brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and vanilla to the apples. Toss well to coat the apples evenly. Set aside.

### Preheat the Oven

For baking a pie, it's best to place the oven rack in the middle position. This allows for even heat distribution around the entire pie, ensuring that both the top and bottom crusts are properly baked without burning.

| Oven Type | Temperature | Preheat Time | Baking Time |
|---|----|----|----|
| Conventional | 200°C (392°F) | 10 minutes | 45-50 minutes |
| Convection | 180°C (356°F) | 10 minutes | 35-40 minutes |

### Assemble the Pie

If your pie crust is frozen, thaw it according to the package instructions before using. If you're using a homemade crust, follow the instructions for [Classic Flaky Pie Crust](../Shells/Baked/Classic%20Flaky%20Pie%20Crust.md). 

In either case, you should have a 9-inch (23 cm) pie crust ready for filling and a second crust for the top.

1. Pour the apple filling into the prepared pie crust, mounding it slightly in the center.

1. Carefully place the top crust over the filling. Trim any excess dough hanging over the edges, leaving about a 1-inch (2.5 cm) overhang. Crimp the edges to seal the pie. Cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.

### Finish the Pie (Optional)

1. Brush the top crust with an egg wash and sprinkle with granulated sugar. This will give the pie a beautiful golden color and a sweet crunch.

### Bake the Pie

1. Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips.

1. Bake the pie in the preheated oven.

### Check for Doneness

#### Visual Indicators

>  To prevent the edges of the crust from over-browning while the rest of the pie bakes, you can cover the edges with aluminum foil partway through baking.

- **Golden Brown Crust**: The crust should be golden brown. The top and edges should appear well-baked.

- **Bubbling Filling**: The filling should be actively bubbling through the vents or slits you cut in the top crust. This indicates that the filling is hot and thickened.

#### Other Indicators

- **Juices**: The juices should have a thick consistency and not be too runny. If you see the juices bubbling and they appear thickened, it’s a good sign the pie is done.

- **Firm Crust**: The bottom crust should be cooked through and firm. If it's possible to lift the pie slightly and look at the bottom (maybe through a glass pie dish), it should appear evenly browned.

- **Thermometer Test**: For an even more precise method, you can use an instant-read thermometer. The internal temperature of the pie should be around 95-100°C (203-212°F) when it is fully baked.

### Cool and Serve

1. Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for at least 2 hours before serving. This will help the filling set and make it easier to slice.

1. Serve the apple pie warm with a scoop of vanilla, cinnamon, or caramel ice cream for a delicious treat. You can also top it with whipped cream or a drizzle of caramel sauce. Enjoy!
